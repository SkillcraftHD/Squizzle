# About the Game
Squizzle is a free 2D platformer game availble for both Windows and Android devices
## Links
You can either download the pc version (windows only) on [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/squizzle/728673) or the Mobile version in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GhostBandits.Squizzle&gl=DE).
## Discord Server
If want, you can join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/MQgTSM4qtm) to stay up to date. Although I stopped working on the game, you can still contribute to new ideas and features, I might resume the development if there's something really interesting.
## Why Open Source?
Since I believe that development should be as transparent as possible, I'm making every project's code open source, meaning you can read, copy, and use the code for your own purposes. This can both help people understand how I made the projects and maybe learn something from my code, as well as use the code for their own projects in order to speed up their development. However, don't forget that the code is still under the MIT license, more info in the [License file](LICENSE).
